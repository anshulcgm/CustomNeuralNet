# CustomNeuralNet


A Neural Network implemented in Python with just the use of numpy and other native Python Libraries. This Neural Network can have several hidden layers as backpropagation works through a neuron tracing algorithm. Future improvements would be to incorporate vectorization to speed up the training process.
